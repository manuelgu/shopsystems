# Shop System Knowledge Base

## Introduction

Choosing the right shop system is one of the most critical - and hard to reverse - decisions made early in a project. However, finding a system that truly fits the specific scenario is challenging. One of the main difficulties is the lack of objective, non-marketing information and comparisons. Every system claims to be the “best,” and every customer success story seems flawless (which sadly isn’t always true...).

<div className="highlightText">
    That’s why we’ve decided to publish our entire knowledge base on commercial and open-source shop systems.
</div>

Originally created for internal use, there’s no reason to keep this information private. Unlike large market analysts, we are not paid by any of these vendors, so our insights are truly independent.
