Privacy Policy for Google Analytics Usage

At roq.tech, we use Google Analytics to collect data on how you interact with our website. This data helps us understand user behavior and improve our websiteâ€™s design and functionality. Additionally, we use this information to optimize our marketing campaigns.

Legal Basis for Data Processing

What Data We Collect

With your explicit consent, Google Analytics processes and collects the following personal data:

* Cookies
* IP address (anonymized)

Google Analytics is configured to anonymize your IP address by truncating it within the EU/EEA before transferring it to the United States. This means that your full IP address will never be stored or processed outside the EU/EEA.

Data Retention Period

The data collected via Google Analytics is stored for a maximum of 6 months, after which it is automatically deleted.

International Data Transfers

Google Analytics may transfer your personal data to servers located in the United States. These transfers are made under the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission to ensure your data is adequately protected.

Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

* Right to access: You can request a copy of the personal data we have about you.
* Right to rectification: You can ask us to correct any inaccurate data.
* Right to erasure: You can request that we delete your data.
* Right to restrict processing: You can request that we limit the processing of your personal data.
* Right to data portability: You can request a copy of your data in a commonly used format.
* Right to object: You can object to the processing of your personal data at any time.
* Right to withdraw consent: You can withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

If you believe that the processing of your data violates GDPR, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
