                #### ‚≠ê Highlights
                * Commercetools covers all essential features for both B2C and B2B use cases.
                * It hides much of its complexity internally, making it relatively easy to use.
                * It doesn‚Äôt enforce the use of a specific programming language.
                * Self-developed storefronts and middleware can be hosted by Commercetools, avoiding shared-responsibility situations.

            <div className="col-demo">
                #### üëç When to use
                * For enterprise customers with advanced yet standard e-commerce needs.
                * Shops that require unlimited scalability.
                * Companies with small IT teams (e.g., two frontend- and two backend engineers).

        <div className="col col--4">
            <div className="col-demo">
                #### üëé When to avoid
                * Most marketplace setups that require dedicated user interfaces for merchants.
                * Projects with unique requirements that require frequent or extensive custom code changes.
                * Companies that require an on-premise solution for compliance, data security, or other reasons.

## Development approach

:::warning
The entire architecture is in a state of change, which, in our opinion, causes unnecessary risks and efforts for projects. Alternatively, you may decide to use the open source version of Magento 2 instead [üåê](https://developer.adobe.com/open/magento)

                ### Bird‚Äôs eye view

                When building a project with Commercetools, the typical steps may include:

                * Manual configuration of your shop in the Merchant Center
                * Development of your Custom Storefront based either on their templates or from-scratch (see below)
                * Optional: Creation of pages and content in their visual site builder, called Studio
                * Integration with other systems via self-developed Custom Middleware

                ### Storefront approach

                Projects may start building from scratch or use their frontend solution, which is an entire suite of tools, that consists of

                -   a Next.js based storefront, pre-integrated with Commercetools. There are templates for B2C [üåê](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-development/b2c-store-launchpad-overview) and B2B [üåê](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-development/b2b-store-launchpad-overview) scenarios.
                -   a hosting environment that is based on a Node.js environment (Extension runner) and a frontend delivery system (Frontend delivery) based on Netlify and GCP
                -   and a visual site builder for non-technical users called Studio [üåê](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-studio/)

                ### Embedded SaaS Checkout

                Projects can decide if they implement their checkout themselves or use Commercetools' one-page checkout¬†that ships with a configurable user interface [üåê](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/overview).

                ### Integration middleware

                Typically, customers want to integrate their shop with other IT systems, such as ERP, warehouse-software or PIM.

                Since Commercetools is a closed system, these integrations must be custom developed using various techniques, like their APIs, an Import-API [üåê](https://docs.commercetools.com/import-export/) for bulk imports and the event system [üåê](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/subscriptions).

                Teams that are using Java, can use the official Java-SDK[üåê](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/java-sdk-middleware).

                ### Merchant Center

                Commercetools is managed through their admin UI, called Merchant Center. It's used for initial configuration and for managing entities such as orders, customers, and products:

                ### Merchant Center Extensions

                You may want to add custom pages and logic to the Merchant Center, which is a SaaS application (so direct code modifications are not possible).

                Commercetools uses a technique called Micro Frontend, allowing you to implement a small application that leverages their authentication and UI Kit for a consistent look and feel. This mini-app is then integrated into the Merchant Center, appearing as a seamless part of the interface.

                ### Hosting options

                While Commercetools is fully managed by their team, your custom storefront and middleware require a scalable, high-availability hosting solution. You can either use any cloud provider, such as Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku, or leverage their Connect solution, which offers a managed hosting environment [üåê](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/)
