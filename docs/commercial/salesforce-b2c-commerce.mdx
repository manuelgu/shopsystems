                ### Salesforce B2C Commerce

                Originally known as [Demandware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demandware), an early cloud-based e-commerce solution, it was acquired by Salesforce in 2016. Salesforce B2C Commerce focuses on B2C commerce for retail brands. The platform can be extended using Salesforce Commerce Cloud's proprietary scripting language, ISML (Internet Store Markup Language), along with JavaScript for front-end customizations.

                ### Salesforce B2B Commerce

                In contrast to the B2C system, the B2B Commerce solution is native to the Salesforce platform. As a result, it has a different architecture and requires different development skills, such as expertise in Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and Salesforce's declarative tools, compared to the JavaScript and ISML-based development used in B2C Commerce. You can read more about the differences here: [üåê](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-b2c-commerce-vs-b2b-commerce-what-are-the-differences/)

                ### Extension concept (Cartridges)

                Although Salesforce B2C Commerce (SFCC) is a closed-source system, it can be extended at the code level using a modular approach called Cartridges.

                Unlike other SaaS platforms that rely on APIs or events for integration, Cartridges function as Java plugins within the same JVM, allowing direct access to the core system.

                Cartridges are written in JavaScript, uploaded to the Cartridge directory, and executed within SFCC using the Rhino Engine, which compiles the JavaScript into Java code.

                ### Storefront approach

                Projects can be developed from scratch or by using the "Retail React App," a template designed for B2C shops. The PWA, built with React and Chakra UI, runs on Salesforce's Managed Runtime, eliminating the need for external hosting.
