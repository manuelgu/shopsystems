                * The underlying Java platform (Hybris) was released in 2001, making SAP Commerce a highly mature and battle-tested system.

                SAP Commerce is limited in supporting Marketplace use cases, as it does not include a dedicated merchant portal. For this purpose, SAP officially recommends an additional vendor like Mirakl [üåê](https://www.sap.com/products/crm/commerce-marketplace-management.html).

                ### Bird‚Äôs eye view

                SAP Commerce Cloud is a suite of e-commerce services run by SAP on Azure.

                Its core component, the "Platform," is a headless application built on Java and Spring, previously known as Hybris.

                The storefront can either be built from scratch or using the "Composable Storefront" framework, which is pre-integrated with SAP's CMS, SmartEdit.

                Overview: [üåê](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/explore-the-technical-essentials-of-sap-commerce-cloud/sap-commerce-cloud-system-architecture_eaf56ab6-5a53-47a2-a3c2-67236f1057a8)

                ### Extendability

                There are multiple approaches to tailor SAP Commerce to specific needs:

                -   Full Source Code Access: Licensed customers receive access to the complete source code of SAP Commerce (formerly Hybris). This allows for in-depth customization of the platform. SAP Commerce provides an extension architecture designed to ensure that customizations do not interfere with updates, enabling the platform to remain updatable even after modifications.

        <div className="col col--6">
            <div className="col-demo">
                -   Side-by-Side Extensibility: This approach focuses on maintaining a clean core without making code-level changes. Instead, businesses can build web services that integrate with SAP Commerce using APIs and events. SAP's Kyma Runtime [üåê](https://kyma-project.io/#/) running on an isolated Kubernetes cluster supports this by enabling the development of custom microservices and serverless functions. This allows for extensions without altering the core platform, ensuring updates and system stability are maintained.


                ‚ö†Ô∏è Some customers have informed us that the Kyma runtime is a separate product, incurring additional licensing fees.

                ### Storefront approach

                SAP offers a template-based solution called Composable Storefront, built on Angular. It is available exclusively to licensed customers.

                However, there is an open-source alternative called "Spartacus," which can be used by customers of SAP Hybris on-premise (now end-of-life, as noted below). You can find the repository here: [üåê](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/) and an official explanation video here: [üåê](https://microlearning.opensap.com/playlist/dedicated/178318381/1_sokuy66v/1_byncj8az)

                While it was previously possible to self-host SAP Commerce, the on-premise version is now deprecated and will no longer be supported after mid-2026. Existing customers must transition to the cloud version or another shop system.
