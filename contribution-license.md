Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

1\. Introduction, Scope, and Definitions
========================================

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") applies to any contribution ("Contribution") You make to the repository located at https://github.com/roqtech/shopsystems for the ROQ Tech Knowledge base knowledge base ("Project"). The Project is maintained by ROQ Technology GmbH (referred to as the "Maintainer"). By submitting a Contribution, You agree to the terms set out in this Agreement, which governs the relationship between You and the Maintainer and ensures that the Maintainer receives the necessary legal rights to Your Contribution.

In this Agreement, "You" refers to the individual or legal entity, including its affiliates, making the Contribution. An affiliate is defined as any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You or the legal entity. The term "Project" refers to any and all open-source projects maintained by the Maintainer, including this knowledge base or any other related repositories. A "Contribution" refers to any type of work You submit, including code, documentation, designs, feedback, or any other original content. The term "Submitted" covers any method by which a Contribution is conveyed, including but not limited to pull requests, commits, issues, emails, or other electronic or verbal communications made with the Project, its maintainers, or other contributors.

2\. Grant of Rights to the Maintainer
=====================================

By submitting a Contribution, You grant the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contribution, as well as any derivative works based on it. This license grants the Maintainer the flexibility to use Your Contribution in any way that furthers the development or distribution of the Project. You retain ownership of Your Contribution, but this Agreement allows the Maintainer to incorporate Your work into the Project and related activities without requiring further approval from You.

As far as legally permitted by German law, You also waive any moral rights You may hold in the Contribution, including the right to be identified as its author or to object to modifications made to it. The Maintainer has full discretion in deciding whether or not to attribute Your work. This waiver ensures that the Maintainer can freely adapt and use Your Contribution as necessary, while respecting the limitations imposed by intellectual property law.

You acknowledge that third parties who access the Project may use and modify Your Contribution to submit updates or improvements back to the Project. However, this limited license does not grant third parties the right to sublicense or commercially distribute Your Contribution outside of the Project itself.

3\. Contributor's Representations and Warranties
================================================

In submitting a Contribution, You confirm that Your work is Your original creation or that You have the necessary rights to submit it. You affirm that Your Contribution is not subject to any third-party agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements, and does not contain proprietary or confidential information belonging to another party. You also confirm that You have the legal authority to grant the licenses described in this Agreement and that Your Contribution does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, or trade secrets.

Furthermore, You guarantee that Your Contribution is free of malicious code, viruses, or other harmful software. It complies with all applicable laws, particularly those related to software safety, data protection, and any other legal obligations relevant to the Project. You also affirm that Your Contribution is objective, factual, and free from defamatory language, hate speech, or untruthful claims. Contributions promoting illegal activities or containing misleading information will not be tolerated, and You commit to maintaining a respectful and professional tone in all submissions.

The Maintainer reserves the right to accept or reject any Contribution at its discretion. There is no obligation on the part of the Maintainer to include Your Contribution in the Project, even after it has been submitted. The decision to accept or reject a Contribution may be made without providing an explanation.

4\. General Terms and Governing Law
===================================

This Agreement is governed by and will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of Germany. Any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement will be resolved exclusively in the courts of Berlin, Germany, and You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of these courts, regardless of where You reside.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Maintainer concerning Contributions to the Project. It supersedes any prior agreements or communications regarding Contributions. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

By submitting a Contribution, You confirm that You have read and understood the terms of this Agreement and agree to be legally bound by them.
