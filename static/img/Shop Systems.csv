HCL Commerce, formerly known as IBM WebSphere Commerce, is an e-commerce platform that was originally developed by IBM in the 1990s. In 2019, HCL Technologies acquired the platform from IBM as part of a broader software acquisition. 

The initial version, called NetCommerce, was developed to sell event tickets and merchandise for the 1996 Olympic Games (source).

⚠️ B2C and B2B are different systems!

B2C Commerce 

Originally known as Demandware, an early cloud-based e-commerce solution, it was acquired by Salesforce in 2016. Salesforce B2C Commerce focuses on B2C commerce for retail brands. The platform can be extended using Salesforce Commerce Cloud’s proprietary scripting language, ISML (Internet Store Markup Language), along with JavaScript for front-end customizations. 

Salesforce B2B Commerce:

In contrast to the B2C system, the B2B Commerce solution is native to the Salesforce platform. As a result, it has a different architecture and requires different development skills, such as expertise in Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and Salesforce’s declarative tools, compared to the JavaScript and ISML-based development used in B2C Commerce.
