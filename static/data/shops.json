CommerceTools is central to this approach, providing the flexibility for each market to adopt and innovate independently.\nRussell explains how Danone’s Specialized Nutrition division, which includes baby formula, needed to deliver consistent, high-quality customer experiences globally while retaining local control. They use microservices to share innovations across markets, reducing the cost and complexity of rolling out new features.\nMenno describes the implementation of an open-source model where pre-selected agencies co-develop on the commercetools platform, increasing development capacity and flexibility. This enables Danone’s global and local teams to collaborate more efficiently, sharing knowledge and resources across markets.\nThey conclude by highlighting how Danone is evolving from legacy systems to a microservices-based approach, facing challenges like data migration and integration with legacy systems, but ultimately aiming for greater agility and innovation across its global markets."
