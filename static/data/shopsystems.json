Salesforce B2C Commerce focuses on B2C commerce for retail brands. The platform can be extended using Salesforce Commerce Cloud’s proprietary scripting language, ISML (Internet Store Markup Language), along with JavaScript for front-end customizations. \n\nSalesforce B2B Commerce:\n\nIn contrast to the B2C system, the B2B Commerce solution is native to the Salesforce platform. As a result, it has a different architecture and requires different development skills, such as expertise in Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and Salesforce’s declarative tools, compared to the JavaScript and ISML-based development used in B2C Commerce.
